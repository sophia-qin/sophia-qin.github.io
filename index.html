        <p> Hi there! I'm Sophia, a second-year studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, originally from sunny SoCal. I'm passionate
          and motivated by technology's ability to create new experiences for everyone to reach their full potential.
          When I'm not studying, I like to jam to music, make midnight grocery runs, and explore new places to eat around the Bay Area.
          I've also recently gained a newfound passion for photography and design, so feel free to reach out if you ever want to embark on adventures and take photos!
